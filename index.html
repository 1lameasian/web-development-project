                    <p>
                        This website was created for a project in my intro to web development class. This portfolio is going to be used to show
                        what I learned in the class and other outside resources. By the end of this project, this portfolio should display the effort
                        and time I put into this class to show all that I know while also introducing myself to anyone who may be reading this.
                    </p>
                    <h3>My Time at KSU:</h3>
                    <p> 
                      I started my journey here at KSU in August of 2022. I originally majored in software engineering, but in my sophomore
                      year, I ended up making the switch to information technology. I had planned on my concentration being in data analytics,
                      but after some unforeseen circumstances, I ended up having to switch my concentration to cyber operations. I am planning
                      on graduating after the 2025 Fall semester as long as all things go well. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When it comes to extracurriculars or any events I've done at the school, there aren't any I've done. Honestly, going to school and
                    working full time was enough on my plate. My varying schedule at work conflicted with me trying to join any clubs or doing any 
                    extracurriculars. My main focus was getting grades in the classes I took while also retaining the knowledge that I learned. I wanted
                    to make money to help my parents when needed while also making them proud by getting a Bachelor's degree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As someone who came into this class with no prior website design experience, I hope that this portfolio can serve as an example. With enough time and hard 
                    work, it's possible to learn and adapt. Learning Java and Python from previous classes had definitely helped, but for those who might feel stuck, effort
                    is all you need to keep going. One day, the effort you put in will bloom, proving that everything was worth. There were times when I got frustrated,
                    but I continued to work and learn different things to better myself so that this portfolio can serve as an example.
                    </p>
