        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>
           My name is Richard Phay and I was born on June 25th, 2004. My parents come from Cambodia and fled here during the Khmer Rouge. They wanted an opportunity for
           their kids to grow up an in environment in which they could flourish. They wanted them to have the chances they didn't. That's why I continue to put 100% into 
           everything I do, to not disappoint them. Growing up, I always wanted to be a "smart" kid. I felt as though it brought a sense of accomplishment to my parents. It 
           proved to them that coming here wasn't a waste. That's why in middle and high school, I continued to take Honors and AP classes to make them proud. Whether I liked
           it or not didn't matter to me, as long as I could see them smile about what I was doing was enough. I've continued to carry this whatever it takes mentality so 
           that I can strive to be the best person. I wish to be someone my parents can brag about, someone they'll always be proud of. 
        </p>
        <h2>Experiences:</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to academic experiences, I don't have many at the college level because I'm also working while in school. However, in high school, I was a part of 
            Beta club which was simply just volunteer work. However, an academic accomplishment would be that I graduated top 10 in high school. I am also looking to maintain a 
            3.5 GPA for when I graduate which I am on pace for.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I were to give a life experience that changed me, it would be when my mom fell ill early last year. I was waiting for her to come home after work but she 
            was running late. When she runs late, she always called to let us know. I decided to call her, and that's when the paramedics had answered the phone. She had collapsed
            at work and was rushed to a hospital. I remember that chilling feeling I got hearing that. My father and I rushed to the hospital. It was packed and they had my mother
            waiting in the hallway for tests. I ended up spending the night by her side in a room as we waited for test results to figure out what was wrong. Sitting there feeling
            hopeless and useless is something I never want to feel. Thoughts of so much more I wanted to accomplish for her rushed through my head. She ended up needing surgery
            and as I waited for her in the waiting room, I broke down. Not knowing what was going on and all these bad thoughts rushed. After her surgery, I steeled myself so 
            that if something ever happens, I could say that I've done enough to make them proud or myself proud.
        </p>
        <h2>Goals:</h2>
        <p>
            The first goal I want is to finish college which I am close to doing. Another goal I hope to accomplish this year is to get an internship or a good paying job
            while in school or after I graduate. My goal is to become financially stable by age 25 so that I can move out and have some independence. Another big goal is to 
            become a home owner before 30. My biggest goal is to do whatever it takes to make my parents happy.
